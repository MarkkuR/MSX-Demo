A direct-to-screen putpixel routine and test for MSX by Antti Silvast, 2012.

Compiling:
- Type make at the command line. 

Although rarely used by our demos, sometimes putting separate pixels directly to the screen can be an efficient way to draw effects. Manages around 30 pixels (draw+erase) per frame.
